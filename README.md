## Meetings

### Weekly Spin Project Meeting

The Spin Project meeting is a weekly event and alternates between EU friendly and US friendly time zones each week. Here, we discuss anything and everything related to the Spin repository, Spin SDKs and guest language support, Spin plugins and more. If you have ideas for new features, are interested in contributing to the project, are an end user of Spin, and/or interested in meeting maintainers, this is a great place to be.

### Bi-Weekly SpinKube Meeting

The SpinKube meeting is a bi-weekly event that occurs at the same time. This meeting focuses on running Spin applications in Kubernetes environments and the projects that make that a possibility: [containerd-shim-spin](https://github.com/spinframework/containerd-shim-spin), [spin-operator](https://github.com/spinframework/spin-operator), [runtime-class-manager](https://github.com/spinframework/runtime-class-manager). If you're interested in running Spin application on Kubernetes, contributing to these projects or extending SpinKube, this is a great meeting to attend.
